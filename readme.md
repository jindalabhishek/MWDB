**About The Project**
The project has been done as a part of Phase 2 of CSE 515: Multimedia and Web Database.
In this project, you will experiment with
• image features,
• vector models, 
• dimensionality curse,
• graph analysis


**Prerequisites:**
* Numpy
* Opencv
* Sklearn
* Skimage
* Json
* Python3.5 or later
* PIL 
* PyMongo Library (Mongo Client) 
* Mongo DB 


**Installation:**

On ubuntu/linux:
* Pip install -r requirement.txt


**Usage**:
To run:

o Task 1:
▪ Given image folder as an input and their corresponding labels image type (for example: cc,con,jitter):
▪ Run Command python Task_1.py

o Task 2
▪ Given image folder as an input and their corresponding labels subject id (for example: subject id 1-40):
▪ Run Command python Task_2.py

o Task 3
▪ Given image folder as an input and their corresponding labels image type, subject id,image sample id (for example: image-X-Y-Z):
